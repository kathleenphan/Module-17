# Module-17
In this module we had to resample the Loan Stats data, build and evaluate logisitc regression models and then determine which models should be recomended. The different models were oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE oversampling and a combination of over and under sampling. Oversampling produced a .64 accuracy score, SMOTE oversampling gave a .66 accuracy score, undersampling gave a .54 accuracy score and the combination gave a .54 accuracy score. Based on accuracy the SMOTE oversampling method produces the best results. Although the accuracy scores are not very far apart from one another, every method produced different clasification reports showing an improvement in metrics in certain models.
